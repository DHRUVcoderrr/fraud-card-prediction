# fraud-card-prediction
Got it 🚀 Here’s a **README.md** template for a **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project you can put on GitHub. I’ll keep it professional, clean, and beginner-

This repository contains a machine learning project for **detecting fraudulent credit card transactions**. Fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning, helping financial institutions reduce risks and protect customers from unauthorized transactions.

---

## 📌 Features

* Data preprocessing & handling **imbalanced datasets** (fraud cases are rare).
* Implementation of machine learning models:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Trees / Random Forest
  * Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)
* Model evaluation using metrics like:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  * ROC-AUC Score
* Visualization of fraud vs non-fraud transactions.
